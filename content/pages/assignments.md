On-line Discussion Forum
------------------------

On the Wednesday before each recitation section, a topic for discussion will be posted on the web site. You are required to make at least one submission to the on-line forum before the next recitation section. These contributions should be of reasonable length, thoughtful and relevant to the current discussion.

Your contributions will be graded. If you have not submitted to the web site before recitation, you will receive a zero for that week's grade. Discussion in recitation will also relate to the topic posted on the forum.
